A simple story game when you have only 100 clicks to finish the story.
Where you should re-play several time to improve your path.
But all actions you done in the past are repeated which helps you to
accelerate actions and progress further and further.

## Play

https://restimel.github.io/100clicks/

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
