The run is over and you have to restart from the begining.\nBut all clicks done in previous runs will continue to be applied on actions.\nFor example, for an action that needs 2 clicks: On run #1, you clicked on it at click #10 and click #11 (which complete the action). So at run #2, if you do the same action at click #10 then the action will be completed immediately. And at run #3, this action will be completed at click #10 even if you choosed another action.\nThis mechanism helps you to progress faster and consequently to go further in the story with only 100 clicks.",
